# Train Departure App 

## A mockup of an app designed to allow users to have a widget display the train arrival times of the closest BART station to their current location. However, BART's API has made the delays section slightly buggy, as times over 60 minutes were displayed due to incorrect information. In addition, to make sure all train amounts (2,3,4 platforms) can be accomodated for all train stations, make sure to use the large widget size rather than medium.
